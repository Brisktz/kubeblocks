**What is KubeBlocks**

The name KubeBlocks is derived from Kubernetes and LEGO blocks, which indicates that building database and analytical
workloads on Kubernetes can be both productive and enjoyable, like playing with construction toys. KubeBlocks combines
the large-scale production experiences of top cloud service providers with enhanced usability and stability.

**Why you need KubeBlocks**

When adopting a multi-cloud or hybrid cloud strategy, it is crucial to prioritize application portability and utilize
software or services that offer consistent functionality across different infrastructures. Kubernetes, to some extent,
helps achieve this goal, and KubeBlocks further enhances the management experience for stateful services. KubeBlocks
integrates popular database engines and provides rich management capabilities on various infrastructures using a
declarative API, resulting in an improved development experience.

With simple configuration, you can integrate KubeBlocks, and since its open-source release, databases such as
NebulaGraph, RisingWave, Pika, GreptimeDB, and OceanBase have seamlessly joined the ecosystemã€‚
